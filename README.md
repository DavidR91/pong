# pong
An imperfect attempt at creating pong with emphasis on receiving and rebuilding state rather than mutating global/shared state (as well as a random mix of certain ES6 features).

[DEMO](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DavidR91/pong/blob/master/demo.html)  (terrible AI vs. terrible AI, no user input)

**This project is intentionally over-engineered**: It is not an example of how to create a performant interactive application (if anything it's the reverse).
